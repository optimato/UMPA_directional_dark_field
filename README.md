# UMPA_directional_dark_field
Directional Dark Field addition to UMPA
As Desribed in 'X-ray directional dark-field imaging using Unified Modulated Pattern Analysis' Paper by Ronan Smith et.al (2022) - please cite this paper if you use our code

This code relies on UMPA, which can also be downloaded from the Optimato Github Organisation

The simplest method of installation is navigating to the folder containing the setup.py file and install with 'Pip install . --user'

There is an example script showing how to run a simple reconstruction

#This needs Python3.10 or above to use multiprocessing
#Sometimes reconstructions do not run when launched from a Jupyter notebook, if you encounter problems please try 'normal' python
#The multiprocessing elements may not work with Windows
